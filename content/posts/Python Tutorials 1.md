# 1.Print Function
````ruby
print("""Hello World
I am the coder
this is my first progrm.""")
````

**Print is a function that is used to display value. Print is an essential function in Python programming. Print is a simple but very useful function. We generally use a Print function to display string and integer values. Print is the first function that we learn during Python programming. We use the Print function in our first program "HelloWorld".**

# 2.Input Function
````ruby
x = input("Enter the number : ")
print(x) 
````
 

**Input is also a very important function. We use it to get input from the user. Generally, We take input from a user and store it in a variable for use later.  Input is also like a print function but the difference here is a print function only displays the value and the program will end and the input also displays the value but ends after getting input from a user.**

# 3.Comments
```ruby
# This is my first program.
# this is my comment.
```

**Comments are text in code that is ignored by Python. Comment are increase the readability of code and makes it understandable for others.**

# Our First Program
````ruby
print("Hello World")
````
