# What Are Operators in Python? 
### Operators are a symbol or small word which is useful to perform operations in Python programming.

Type Of Operators:-
1. Conditional Operators
2. Logical Operators
3. Identity Operators
4. Arithmetic operators
5. Membership operators
6. Assignment operators
7. Bitwise operator

********************
# Conditional / Comparison Operators in Python
```
Conditional / Comparison Operators In Python
<   Greater Than symbol            1<2
>   Smaller Than symbol            2>1
<=  Equal To And Greater Than      if(i<=10)
>=  Equal To And Smaller Than      if(i>=10)
==  Equal To                       if (x == 10)
!=  Not Equal To                   if(x != 10)
```
**Conditional operators are symbols used when writing conditions. Conditional operators are also known as 'Comparision Operators'. Conditional Operators are one of the most essential operator types in Python.**
*********************
# Logical Operators
```
Python Logical Operators
and      Ex. if(i<10 and i2<20)
or       Ex. if(i<10 or i2<20)
not      
```
**We use logical operators in Python for giving more than two conditions in Python. Logical operators are also used while writing logic in Python that's why these operators are known as logical operators in Python.**
*************
# Identity Operators
```
Python Identity Operators
is        Ex. x is y x=y=5
is not    Ex. x is not y
```
**Identity operators are used to compare the object. We generally compare the value of variables with the use of an identity operator. Identity operators contain 'is' and 'is not'**
****************************
# Arithmetic Operators
```
Python Arithmetic Operators
+   Add  
-   Sub
*   Multiplication
/   Division
%   Modulus          Ex. 4%2 Ans-2 Remaining-0
**  Exponentiation   Ex. 4**3 = Cube of 4
//  Floor division   Ex. 13//2 Original Ans - 6.5  Ans - 6
```
**Arithmetic operators are also known as 'mathematical operators' in Python. We use them to perform mathematical operations**.
***********************
# Membership Operators
```
Python Membership Operators
in          Ex. if(x in y)
not in      Ex. if(x not in y)
```
**Membership operators contain 'is' and 'is not'. We use it to show whether both variables same or not.**
***************************************
# Assignment operators in Python
```
assignment operators in Python 
=   Simple assignment operator 
+=  Add and equal operator
-=  Subtract and equal operator 
*=  Asterisk and equal operator
/=  Divide and equal operator 
%=  Modulus and equal operator 
//= Double divide and equal operator 
```
**We use assignment operators while assigning values to variables.**

***********************************


Example Code For Conditional Operators:-
{{< tabgroup align="right" style="code" >}}
  {{< tab name="Python" >}}
```python
x = 13
if (x <= 13):
    print("X is smaller or equal to 13.")

elif (x >= 13):
    print("X is greater or equal to 13.")

elif (x == 13):
    print("X is equal to 13.")

elif (x != 1):
    print("X is not equal to 13.")

else:
    print("Other Value")
```

Example Code For Conditional Operators:-
```ruby
print(" 1 + 2")
print(" 3 - 2")
print(" 1 * 2")
print(" 2 / 2")
print(" 3 % 2")
print(" 4**2")
print(" 5//2")
```
