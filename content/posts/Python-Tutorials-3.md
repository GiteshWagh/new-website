# Operators in Python 
```ruby
Conditional / Comparison Operators in python
<   Greater Than symbol            1<2
>   Smaller Than symbol            2>1
<=  Equal To And Greater Than      if(i<=10)
>=  Equal To And Smaller Than      if(i>=10)
==  Equal To                       if (x == 10)
!=  Not Equal To                   if(x != 10)
```
**Conditional operators is a symbol or small word which we use when writing conditions. Conditional operators are also known as 'Comparision Operators'. Conditional Operators are one of the most important operator type in Python.**

```ruby
Python Logical Operators
and      EX.if(i<10 and i2<20)
or       EX.if(i<10 or i2<20)
not      
```

```ruby
Python Identity Operators
is        Ex. x is y x =y =5
is not    Ex.x is not y
```
**We use logical operators in Python for giving more than two conditions in python. Logical operators are also used while writing logic in Python that's why these operators are known as logical operators in Python.** 

```ruby
Python Arithmetic Operators
+   Add  
-   Sub
*   Multiplication
/   Division
%	Modulus		        4%2 Ans-2 Remaining-0
**  Exponentiation		Ex. 4**3 = Cube of 4
//  Floor division	    13//2 Original Ans - 6.5  Ans - 6
```
**Arithmetic operators are also known as 'mathematical operators' in Python. We use them to perform mathematical operations**.
```ruby
Python Membership Operators
in 		  Ex. if(x in y)	
not in	  Ex. if(x not in y)
```
**Membership operators contain 'is' and 'is not'. We use it to show whether both variables same or not.**

```ruby
assignment operators in Python:- 
=   Simple assignment operator 
+=  Add and equal operator
-=  Subtract and equal operator 
*=  Asterisk and equal operator
/=  Divide and equal operator 
%=  Modulus and equal operator 
//= Double divide and equal operator 
```
**We use assignment operators while assigning values to variables.**

Example Code For Conditional Operators:-
```ruby
x = 13
if (x <= 13):
    print("X is smaller or equal to 13.")

elif (x >= 13):
    print("X is greater or equal to 13.")

elif (x == 13):
    print("X is equal to 13.")

elif (x != 1):
    print("X is not equal to 13.")

else:
    print("Other Value")
```

Example Code For Conditional Operators:-
```ruby
print(" 1 + 2")
print(" 3 - 2")
print(" 1 * 2")
print(" 2 / 2")
print(" 3 % 2")
print(" 4**2")
print(" 5//2")
```
